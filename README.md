**DevOpsDaily is a simple RESTful API application to provide access to a database of users and performing various actions on it.**

For simplicity, the database will be stored as a simple JSON file in the following format:<br>
*users.json*:
```json
{
    "duncan_long": {
        "id": "drekaner",
        "name": "Duncan Long",
        "favorite_color": "Blue"
    },
    "kelsea_head": {
        "id": "wagshark",
        "name": "Kelsea Head",
        "favorite_color": "Ping"
    },
    "phoenix_knox": {
        "id": "jikininer",
        "name": "Phoenix Knox",
        "favorite_color": "Green"
    },
    "adina_norton": {
        "id": "slimewagner",
        "name": "Adina Norton",
        "favorite_color": "Red"
    }
}

```
